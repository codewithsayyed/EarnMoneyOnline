  <p>CoinDesk's Cryptocurrency Calculator determines the exchange rates between major fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies – including BTC, BCH, ETH and XRP to USD, EUR, GBP, IDR and NGN – with up to six decimal places of accuracy. Conversion rates are based on the price indices of digital assets. World currency prices are based on rates obtained via Open Exchange Rates.</p>

          Blockchain
        </div>
        <p>The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin. Currency codes for representing bitcoin are BTC[a] and XBT.[b][22]: 2  Its Unicode character is ₿.[1] One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places.[7]: ch. 5  Units for smaller amounts of bitcoin are the millibitcoin (mBTC), equal to 1⁄1000 bitcoin, and the satoshi (sat), which is the smallest possible division, and named in homage to bitcoin's creator, representing 1⁄100000000 (one hundred millionth) bitcoin.[2] 100,000 satoshis are one mBTC.[23]
          Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. To achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership, each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain.[26] At varying intervals of time averaging to every 10 minutes, a new group of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes, without requiring central oversight. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin was spent, which is needed to prevent double-spending. A conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it, but as a digital ledger, bitcoins only exist by virtue of the blockchain; they are represented by the unspent outputs of transactions.[7]: ch. 5 

          Individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions within blocks can be examined using a blockchain explorer.

          Transactions
        </div>
        <p>
          Transactions are defined using a Forth-like scripting language.[7]: ch. 5  Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs. When a user sends bitcoins, the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin being sent to that address in an output. To prevent double spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain.[28] The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. Since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer.[28] Any input satoshis not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.[28]

          In the blockchain, bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses. Creating a bitcoin address requires creating a random private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation requires only a fraction of a second. But the reverse, computing the private key of a given bitcoin address, is practically unfeasible.[7]: ch. 4  A bitcoin address may be published without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so large that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key pair that is already in use and has funds. This makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used to compromise a private key. To be able to spend bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding private key and digitally sign the transaction.[d] The network verifies the signature using the public key; the private key is never revealed.[7]: ch. 5

          Mining
        </div>
        <p>Mining is a record-keeping service done through the use of computer processing power.[f] Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified by recipient nodes.[24] Each block contains a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the previous block,[24] thus linking it to the previous block and giving the blockchain its name.[7]: ch. 7 [24]

        <p>Every 10 minutes,[47] the successful miner finding the new block is allowed by the rest of the network to collect for themselves all transaction fees from transactions they included in the block, as well as a predetermined reward of newly created bitcoins.[48] As of 11 May 2020, this reward is ₿6.25 in newly created bitcoins per block.[49] To claim this reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included in the block, with the miner as the payee.[7]: ch. 8  All bitcoins in existence have been created through this type of transaction. The bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be reduced by half every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), until ₿21 million[h] are generated. The last new bitcoin will be generated around the year 2140. After that, a successful miner would be rewarded by transaction fees only.[50]

          Decentralization
        </div>
        <p>Conversely, researchers have pointed out a "trend towards centralization". Although bitcoin can be sent directly from user to user, in practice intermediaries are widely used.[25]: 220–222  Bitcoin miners join large mining pools to minimize the variance of their income.[25]: 215, 219–222 [53]: 3 [54] Because transactions on the network are confirmed by miners, decentralization of the network requires that no single miner or mining pool obtains 51% of the hashing power, which would allow them to double-spend coins, prevent certain transactions from being verified and prevent other miners from earning income.[55] As of 2013 just six mining pools controlled 75% of overall bitcoin hashing power.[55] In 2014 mining pool Ghash.io obtained 51% hashing power which raised significant controversies about the safety of the network. The pool has voluntarily capped its hashing power at 39.99% and requested other pools to act responsibly for the benefit of the whole network.[56] Around the year 2017, over 70% of the hashing power and 90% of transactions were operating from China.[57]

          Privacy and fungibility

        </div>
        <p>Bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that funds are not tied to real-world entities but rather bitcoin addresses. Owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. In addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through "idioms of use" (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses.[58] Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information.[59] To heighten financial privacy, a new bitcoin address can be generated for each transaction.[60]

          Wallets
        </div>
        <p>A wallet stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. While wallets are often described as a place to hold[63] or store bitcoins, due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger. A wallet is more correctly defined as something that "stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings" and allows one to access (and spend) them. [7]: ch. 1, glossary  Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated.[64] At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.

Forks of Bitcoin Core exist, such as Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited,[68] and Parity Bitcoin.[69]
